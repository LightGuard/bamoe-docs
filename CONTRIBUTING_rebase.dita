         <p>Rebasing should <b>ONLY</b> be performed on your own feature branches and <b>ONLY</b> before a pull request has been submitted.
<b>NEVER</b> after a pull request has been created.</p>

         <xref href="https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Branching-Rebasing" scope="external">Rebasing</xref> is essentially taking your changes in a branch, saving them, merging something new into the branch, then applying those same changes on top of the merge.
It creates different commits and commit ids and can really mess with history of published branches.
For simplicity both for yourself and others, donâ€™t use rebasing.
A preferred alternative is to merge the other branch into your feature branch and push the whole thing together in one pull request.</p>
