      <p>A boxed every offers a visual representation of an iterator statement.
For the <tt>every</tt> loop, the right part of the <tt>every</tt> displays the iterator variable name.
The second row holds an expression representing the collection that will be iterated over.
The expression in the <tt>in</tt> row MUST resolve to a collection.
The last line is an expression that will be evaluated on each item.
The expression defined in the <tt>satisfies</tt> must resolve to a boolean.</p>
