   <title>Step 3: Add Business Automation Assets</title>
   <body>
      <p>If your project is migrated from a previous version of the product, you can add the business automation files from the previous project to the <tt>src/main/resources</tt> folder of the new project by copying the files.
If you need to create a new file, use <tt>File : New File</tt> option from VS Code, making sure to specify the file extension to associate the new file with the appropriate editor.</p>
