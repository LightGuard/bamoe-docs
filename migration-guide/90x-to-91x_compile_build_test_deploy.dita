      <p>You can follow the standard guidance on how to maintain your decision service project, including how to build using Maven and how to deploy to your target Kubernetes-based environment.
This includes not only creating and publishing the new project to an enterprise GIT repository but also configuring your CI/CD pipeline to pull from GIT and performing a Maven build/test/deploy, etc.</p>
      <note type="note">
         <p>After completing the migration of the project, you might want to consider migrating your technical rules to use new language features, such as <tt>rule units</tt> and <tt>OOPATH syntax</tt>.
Refer to <xref href="drl.html">Drools Rule Language Migration</xref> for information on migrating to the latest version of Drools Rule Language (DRL).</p>
