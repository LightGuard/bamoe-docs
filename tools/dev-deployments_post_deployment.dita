      <p>After approximately 30 seconds, a green checkmark should appear next to the Dev Deployment.
If the deployment was made with the <tt>Include DMN Form Webapp</tt> option checked, selecting an item in the dropdown will allow you to navigate to the webapp form for decisions. Otherwise, it will navigate to the Swagger UI for your application.</p>
      <note type="note">
Dev Deployments are immutable; therefore, if an error occurs or a change is required, a new Dev Deployment must be created.
They can easily be deleted from the Dev Deployments dropdown.
