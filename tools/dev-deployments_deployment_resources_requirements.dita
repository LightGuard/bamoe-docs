   <title>Deployment resources requirements</title>
   <body>
      <p>The Kubernetes/OpenShift resources created by a Dev Deployment must have a few labels and annotations so that BAMOE Canvas can list and manage these resources.</p>
      <p>For a successful deployment, this is the required information each resource needs:</p>
      <codeblock outputclass="language-yaml">
metadata:
  name: \${{ devDeployment.uniqueName }}
  namespace: \${{ devDeployment.kubernetes.namespace }}
  labels:
    \${{ devDeployment.labels.createdBy }}: kie-tools
    \${{ devDeployment.labels.partOf }}: \${{ devDeployment.uniqueName }}
  annotations:
    \${{ devDeployment.annotations.workspaceId }}: \${{ devDeployment.workspace.id }}
    \${{ devDeployment.annotations.workspaceName }}: \${{ devDeployment.workspace.name }}
</codeblock>
      <ul>
         <li>The <tt>name</tt> is how the deployment is identified across the board.</li>
         <li>The <tt>namespace</tt> is where the deployment should be created in the cluster and should be the same configured in the connected account.</li>
         <li>The labels (<tt>createdBy</tt> and <tt>partOf</tt>) are required so that BAMOE Canvas can filter and map all resources related to a single deployment. <b>Important:</b>
            <tt>createdBy</tt> should always have the value <tt>kie-tools</tt>.</li>
         <li>The annotations (<tt>workspaceId</tt> and <tt>workspaceName</tt>) help match a deployment to a workspace.</li>
      </ul>
      <note type="note">
Itâ€™s important to note that our Dev Deployment service inside BAMOE Canvas already applies these required labels and annotations by patching the resource YAMLs.
